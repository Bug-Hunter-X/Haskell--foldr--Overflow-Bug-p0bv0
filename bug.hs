This Haskell code uses the `foldr` function to compute the sum of a list of numbers. However, it contains a subtle bug related to the accumulator type inference. The accumulator type is inferred as `Integer`, which might lead to unexpected behavior if the list contains very large numbers that exceed the capacity of `Integer`. If the list has a sum that exceeds the maximum value that can be stored as an `Integer`, the result will wrap around, leading to incorrect results.

```haskell
foldr (+) 0 [1..1000000000000000000]
```
